#Common Interview Questions

Many tech companies will have a coding interview set of questions to weed out weak/unqualified developers. This repository is meant to share those common questions as well as solutions in various programming languages. This guide can be used to study or prepare for these type of questions and help prepare for an interview. If you struggle with any of the solutions, please take the time to brush up and make sure that you you understand the material.

Many of the questions that you will encounter will be about time complexity of algorithms, usually in Big-O notation. These questions shows that you are capable of analyzing your solution, and that you consider other solutions as well. Take a look at [this Big-O cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

You will also come across questions/tasks regarding string manipulations, reversing a string without using any internal string reverse functinons, reversing the words in a string, determining if one string is a permutation of another, etc.
